description: '"The Belton estate (1865) by Anthony Trollope is a fine example of the
  author''s favorite subjects: social and family relationships, inheritance, a young
  woman faced with the delicate choice of worthy husbands, and a sophisticated portrayal
  of British Victorian life. Clara Amedroz, the lady in question, must find her place,
  after deaths in the family leave her vulnerable and without a fortune. Her home,
  the Belton Estate, has been entailed. And before happiness can be had, Clara must
  be sensible, patient, and above all tactful in the face of difficulty, not to mention
  an unspeakable mother-in-law"--P. [4] of cover.'
